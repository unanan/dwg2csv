dwg2csv
=======

##### Export data from dwg files via AutoCAD ActiveX API
##### 
##### This set of Python scripts and other files was born in 2011, when I was working on a task with goal to migrate some data from AutoCAD to a GIS solution.
##### For data access interface I had chosen AutoCAD ActiveX API (that was a mistake, after all).
##### For data processing and scripting the Python was selected because it's my favorite programming language.
##### 
##### Export from DWG (AutoCAD) to CSV.
##### 
##### COM (ActiveX) AutoCAD API was used for access to drawing entities and for extracting geometry and attributes from them.
##### 
##### Python modules `comtypes.client`, `comtypes.gen` used for interaction with AutoCAD.
##### Module `csv.writer` for data export.
##### 
##### For make it work you will need MS Windows, Autodesk AutoCAD, Python >= 2.5.

##### * trig.py -- functions for coordinates transformation and other math stuff.
##### * dwg.list -- list of input dwg files example.
##### * rip.cmd -- runner cmd script example.
##### * test.py -- tests for recovery DWG entities from exported data.
##### * ora/csv.lob2ora.py -- CSV to Oracle loader, load data exported from DWG to Oracle DB using cx_Oracle. For coords data CLOB field was used because of data size.
